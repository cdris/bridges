Our program is basically a loop that checks each of its ports for any incoming messages.
If there is a message, it is delegated to a handler function based on its type (either
'bpdu' or 'data'). We have a class for bridges with fields to hold onto the bridge id,
root, root port, and cost to root. We also have a class for ports with fields to hold
the actual socket, the most recent bpdu that has come in on that port, a boolean flag
to say whether the port is open, and a timeout for the port's bpdu.

We thoroughly tested our code against the provided test files as well as running our own
unit tests on our functions. We used the run script far more than the test script, as it
gave more helpful information for debugging.

We found the logic for closing ports very challenging. We are still working on it, but
our logic thusfar is sufficient to pass the first 6 simple test cases.
